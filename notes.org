- save
  - get auth token
  - encode to gob bytes
  - encode using key derived from clientSecret
  - save to disk

- load
  - load from disk
  - decode using key derived from clientSecret
  - decode from gob bytes

*** DONE encrypting

- dk, err := scrypt.Key([]byte("some password"), salt, 32768, 8, 1, 32)
- then use AES

* DONE check if token *ever* expires
CLOSED: [2018-07-07 Sat 13:07]
if it doesn't, we don't have to re-save after load

- it does expire, but let's see what happens if I try to use an expired
  token, if it auto-refreshes or what

- oh heck yeah, expired tokens auto-refresh so we good

* conditionally re-save the token, only if it's changed
- saving is somewhat expensive because of scrypt, so we shouldn't do it all the dang time, let's just do it only if the token has changed.

* DONE is there a way to save the ID and Secret at build time?
CLOSED: [2018-07-07 Sat 12:53]
turns out yes there is:

go build -ldflags "-X main.<variable>=$<NAME>"

* try some literate ass programming and see how it works with editing mode
I'm gonna guess not so good

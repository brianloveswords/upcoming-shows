* DONE save token
CLOSED: [2018-07-07 Sat 11:27]
- save
  - get auth token
  - encode to gob bytes
  - encode using key derived from clientSecret
  - save to disk

- load
  - load from disk
  - decode using key derived from clientSecret
  - decode from gob bytes

*** DONE encrypting
CLOSED: [2018-07-07 Sat 11:27]
- dk, err := scrypt.Key([]byte("some password"), salt, 32768, 8, 1, 32)
- then use AES

* DONE check if token *ever* expires
CLOSED: [2018-07-07 Sat 13:07]
if it doesn't, we don't have to re-save after load

- it does expire, but let's see what happens if I try to use an expired
  token, if it auto-refreshes or what

- oh heck yeah, expired tokens auto-refresh so we good

* DONE is there a way to save the ID and Secret at build time?
CLOSED: [2018-07-07 Sat 12:53]
turns out yes there is:

go build -ldflags "-X main.<variable>=$<NAME>"

* DONE use ~open~ to just open the url for the user
instead of making them copy and paste a link, maybe that would be better

* DONE do songkick searches to get the songkick ids
- open search
- wait on stdin for the id
- https://www.songkick.com/search?utf8=âœ“&query=${artist}

- make sure to url encode the artist name

* DONE make playlist from songkick url
- eg: https://www.songkick.com/concerts/33692814-royal-they-at-alphaville
- scrape Line-up, add latest album from each band to playlist

  babysteps
  - [X] create playlist
  - [X] add latest album for 1 artist by ID to playlist
  - [X] artist search -> spotify ID
  - [X] scrape lineup (page -> [artistIDs])

* DONE conditionally re-save the token, only if it's changed
- saving is somewhat expensive because of scrypt, so we shouldn't do it all the dang time, let's just do it only if the token has changed.

* DONE printing
think about:

- which functions should print at all, and which are "internal" and should shut the fuck up and just return different types of errors?
- different levels of verbose? debug/verbose/normal/silent
- how to structure debugging printer so it's ~grep~ friendly
- 1 global logger to rule them all
- everything prints to stderr except CmdOutput
- color optional?
- env var, LOGLEVEL:<debug|verbose|normal|silent>

logger.Debug

- [debug] playlist:create:request-songkick-page: requesting page
- [debug] playlist:create:parse-songkick-page: parsing page
- [debug] playlist:create:parse-songkick-page: extracted xyz
- [debug] playlist:create:parse-songkick-page: couldn't do the thing

* DONE store things according to XDG Base Directory Specification
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

data: $XDG_DATA_HOME or $HOME/.local/share/
config: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME/.config/
cache: $XDG_CACHE_HOME or $HOME/.cache/


config:
- nothing yet

data:
- encrypted oauth token

cache:
- spotify data, like saved tracks
- songkick data, like spotifyID->songkickID mapping

* import from urls

- songkick (that's done, really)
- tiny mix tapes
- pitchfork
- discogs?

* albums I should spend money on

- analyze listening patterns, top tracks
- figure out what I artists I should be showing support

* command parser, part 2
*** examples
*play*
*pause*
*skip*
*prev*
*fav*

*auth show*
*auth login*
*auth logout*
*auth export [outfile=-]*
*auth import [infile=-]*

*playlist create <name>*
- playlist create "hey yo what up"
- playlist create --name="hey yo what up"

*playlist from-url <url> [tracks=latest|random|all] [length=10]*
- playlist from-url http://songkick.com/concerts/1234-yep --tracks=all

*mix by-artist [artist=%current-artist%] [length=10] [name='{mix} %artist%']*
- mixtape by-artist ~# use defaults~
- mixtape by-artist chavez  ~# name is 1st positional argument~
- mixtape by-artist chavez 10 "dem chavez songs" ~# all positional~
- mixtape by-artist --length=10 chavez
- mixtape by-artist --length=10 --artist=chavez
- mixtape by-artist --length=10 --artist=chavez --name="lol cool"

- mixtape by-track --id=a2da3f

*** parsing
- pull out args

[mixtape, by-artist, chavez, 10, "dem chavez songs"]



* discogs + labels

- use the [[https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:database,header:database-all-label-releases][discogs API]] to look up labels
- create a playlist of all albums released by that label




* command line smoke tester
cmd.Lint(t)


- check examples
  - does it parse?
  - if there are parameters, there should be examples
  - is there an example for each parameter?
- check documentation
- check for unreachable cmds
* thinking about interfaces

cli is but one interface, another could be web server
determine what is part of the interface, and what is business logic

e.g.


interface: cmd.MixtapeFromArtist(artistID string)
- can & should print output
- can exit execution, call fatal
- should handle errors

logic: mixtape.FromArtist(artistID spotify.ID) (playlist spotify.ID, err error)
- should not print output
  - exception: debugging
- should not panic
  - exception: programmer error, e.g. preconditions fail
